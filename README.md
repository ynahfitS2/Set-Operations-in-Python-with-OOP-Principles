  This program is a menu-oriented program, designed to perform four set operations, such as 
subset checking, union, intersection, and symmetric difference, on two sets provided by the user. It 
utilizes object-oriented programming concepts, such as abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and 
polymorphism, to organize and execute these operations efficiently. It provides a console-based 
interface where users can input values for two sets, choose from various set operations: Subset, 
Union, Intersection, and Symmetric Difference. Then, displays the results with explanatory 
descriptions. The goal is to help learners understand basic concepts about union, intersection, 
subset, and symmetric difference, and to provide an interactive way for users to learn and practice 
set operations in python.
